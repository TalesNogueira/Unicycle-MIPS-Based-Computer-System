# Unicycle MIPS based Computer System
## A Unicycle MIPS-based computer system implementing a RISC architecture, designed to execute instructions generated by a C- Compiler

This repository contains a Unicycle MIPS-based computer system implementing a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture, designed to execute instructions generated by a C- Compiler â€” a reduced subset of the C language [(1)](https://github.com/TalesNogueira/C-Minus-Compiler). The system is structured around a single-cycle (unicycle) datapath and control logic, following the MIPS instruction set principles.
